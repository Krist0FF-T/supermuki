# SuperMuki
A simple 2D platformer game I wrote in February 2022.

Small modifications were made since then (most of which are visually unnoticeable). Am planning to create a separate branch for the original code (check [TODO](#todo) for more info).

## TODO
Create branches:
- [ ] "simple": simplified version (1 player, 1 level, 0 menus, etc.): make it clean and good for education purposes (even a tutorial crosses my mind)
- [ ] "original": without newer modifications since Feb. 2022.
- [ ] "improved" (or main): with newer improvements

For ease of installation:
- [ ] installation steps in README
- [ ] create tags and releases
