# SuperMuki
A simple 2D platformer game I wrote in February 2022.

Small modifications were made since then (most of which are visually unnoticeable). Am planning to create a separate branch for the original code (check [TODO](#todo) for more info).

# TODO
- create branches:
    - [ ] "simple": simplified version (1 player, 1 level, 0 menus, etc.): make it clean and good for education purposes (even a tutorial crosses my mind)
    - [ ] "original": without newer modifications since Feb. 2022.
    - [ ] "improved" (or main): with newer improvements
- for ease of installation:
    - [ ] installation steps in README
    - [ ] create tags and releases
- [ ] move screenshots out of repo: use assets instead
